A guardrail runs on the hot path, so we care about three things a general chatbot doesn't
obsess over: **latency**, **memory**, and **calibration** (not over-blocking). Architecture
drives all three. This guide builds up from the shared transformer skeleton, then dives into
each model in the [registry](../src/agent_bouncer/models/registry.py).

## 1 · Two shapes of model: encoder vs decoder

Agent Bouncer uses **both** families, because safety can be framed two ways.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph ENC["Encoder (DistilBERT) — classify"]
      A1["prompt"] --> A2["bidirectional<br/>self-attention"] --> A3["[CLS] vector"] --> A4["linear head<br/>safe / unsafe"]
    end
    subgraph DEC["Decoder (Qwen3 · SmolLM2 · DeepSeek-R1) — generate"]
      B1["prompt + instruction"] --> B2["causal<br/>self-attention"] --> B3["next-token<br/>generation"] --> B4["JSON verdict<br/>{decision, hazard}"]
    end
```

| | **Encoder** (BERT-family) | **Decoder** (GPT-family) |
|---|---|---|
| Attention | **Bidirectional** (sees whole prompt at once) | **Causal** (left-to-right) |
| Output | One classification per input | A generated token sequence (our JSON verdict) |
| Speed | **Fastest** — one forward pass | Slower — autoregressive decoding |
| Strength | Cheap, calibrated probability | Explains *why*, generalizes, can reason |
| Trains with | SFT only | SFT · **GRPO** · **DPO** |

**Design consequence.** The encoder is the *latency hero* (a per-call gate); decoders are the
*quality/flexibility* option and the only ones you can RL-tune. That split is enforced by the
[technique matrix](fine-tuning.md#which-technique-for-which-model).

---

## 2 · The modern decoder block (shared skeleton)

Qwen3, SmolLM2, and DeepSeek-R1-Distill are all **decoder-only transformers** built from the
same post-Llama recipe. One block:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    X["hidden state h"] --> N1["RMSNorm"]
    N1 --> ATT["Grouped-Query Attention<br/>+ RoPE positions"]
    ATT --> R1(("+"))
    X --> R1
    R1 --> N2["RMSNorm"]
    N2 --> MLP["SwiGLU MLP<br/>(gate ⊙ up) → down"]
    MLP --> R2(("+"))
    R1 --> R2
    R2 --> Y["hidden state h'"]
```

Four ideas do the heavy lifting — worth knowing by name:

- **RMSNorm** — normalizes by root-mean-square only (no mean-subtraction, no bias). Cheaper and
  as stable as LayerNorm; applied *pre*-attention and *pre*-MLP ("pre-norm").
- **RoPE (Rotary Position Embedding)** — encodes position by *rotating* query/key vectors, so
  relative distance is baked into the dot-product. Extrapolates to longer contexts (YaRN/scaling).
- **GQA (Grouped-Query Attention)** — many query heads **share** a smaller set of key/value
  heads. This shrinks the **KV-cache** (the dominant memory + bandwidth cost at inference), which
  is exactly what makes small decoders fast enough to gate traffic.
- **SwiGLU MLP** — a gated feed-forward (`(xW_gate) ⊙ SiLU(xW_up)` then `W_down`). Better quality
  per parameter than plain ReLU MLPs; uses three projection matrices instead of two.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph MHA["Multi-Head Attention (old)"]
      q1["Q×8"] --- k1["K×8"] --- v1["V×8"]
    end
    subgraph GQA["Grouped-Query Attention (used here)"]
      q2["Q×16"] --- k2["K×8"] --- v2["V×8"]
      note["fewer KV heads → smaller KV-cache → faster, lighter"]
    end
```

Stack *N* of these blocks, add a token embedding at the bottom and a projection to the
vocabulary at the top (often **tied** to the embedding on small models to save parameters), and
you have the model. What differs between our SLMs is **how many** blocks, **how wide**, the
**head grouping**, and — crucially — **what they were trained on**.

## 3 · The registry, side by side

Indicative configuration of the released checkpoints (see each model card for exact values):

| Model | Family | Params | Layers | Hidden | Q / KV heads | Vocab | Context | In registry |
|---|---|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|---|
| **DistilBERT** | BERT (encoder) | 66M | 6 | 768 | 12 / 12 | 30k | 512 | `distilbert` |
| **Qwen3-0.6B** | Qwen3 | 0.6B | 28 | 1024 | 16 / 8 | 151k | 32k | `qwen3-0.6b` |
| **Qwen3-1.7B** | Qwen3 | 1.7B | 28 | 2048 | 16 / 8 | 151k | 32k | `qwen3-1.7b` |
| **DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B** | Qwen2.5 | 1.5B | 28 | 1536 | 12 / 2 | 151k | 128k | `deepseek-r1-1.5b` |
| **SmolLM2-1.7B** | Llama-style | 1.7B | 24 | 2048 | 32 / 32 | 49k | 8k | `smollm2-1.7b` |

*(Q/KV heads = query heads / key-value heads; the gap is the GQA grouping.)*

## 4 · Model-by-model

### DistilBERT — the latency hero (encoder)

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    T["tokens + [CLS]"] --> E["embeddings<br/>(token + learned position)"]
    E --> B["6 × transformer<br/>(bidirectional, GELU)"]
    B --> C["[CLS] hidden"] --> H["classifier head"] --> O["P(unsafe)"]
```

DistilBERT is BERT **distilled** to 6 layers (~40% smaller, ~60% faster, ~97% of BERT's GLUE).
It is **bidirectional** and **encoder-only**: it reads the whole prompt and emits one vector,
which a small head turns into a safe/unsafe probability. No autoregressive decoding → **single
forward pass → millisecond latency on CPU**. That's why it's the default per-call gate. The
trade-off: it classifies but can't *explain* or *reason*, and it only supports **SFT**.
→ [`models/encoder.py`](../src/agent_bouncer/models/encoder.py)

### Qwen3-0.6B & 1.7B — the balanced workhorses (decoder)

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Q0["Qwen3 decoder"] --> F1["GQA (16 Q / 8 KV)"]
    Q0 --> F2["QK-Norm on attention<br/>(Qwen3 stability trick)"]
    Q0 --> F3["SwiGLU · RMSNorm · RoPE"]
    Q0 --> F4["tied embeddings (0.6B)"]
    Q0 --> F5["strong multilingual pretraining"]
```

Qwen3 is a modern, well-documented dense decoder. Beyond the shared skeleton it adds **QK-Norm**
(normalizing queries/keys before attention) for training stability, and ships in a family that
spans 0.6B → 235B, so the **same recipe** scales. For us:

- **0.6B** — the smallest capable JSON-emitting guard. Fast on Apple MPS, trainable on a laptop.
  Our default decoder guard and GRPO subject.
- **1.7B** — more capacity (wider, 2048 hidden) for harder red-teaming, at higher latency/memory.

Both support **SFT / GRPO / DPO**. → [`models/decoder.py`](../src/agent_bouncer/models/decoder.py)

### DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B — the reasoning specialist (decoder)

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    R1["DeepSeek-R1<br/>(large reasoning teacher)"] -->|"distill long<br/>chain-of-thought"| D["Qwen2.5-1.5B student"]
    D --> U["emits &lt;think&gt;…&lt;/think&gt;<br/>then the answer"]
    U --> G["→ ideal for GRPO<br/>reasoning guard"]
```

This is a **Qwen2.5-1.5B** base **distilled on reasoning traces** from DeepSeek-R1. Architecturally
it's a Qwen2.5 decoder (note the aggressive GQA: **12 query heads share just 2 KV heads** → a very
small KV-cache), but its *behavior* is the selling point: it natively produces long
chain-of-thought before answering. That makes it a natural fit for the **GRPO reasoning guard**,
where the model thinks briefly, then emits the verdict — and the verifiable reward shapes both the
answer *and* the brevity of the reasoning. → [Fine-tuning: GRPO](fine-tuning.md#grpo--rl-from-a-verifiable-reward)

### SmolLM2-1.7B — the data-quality contender (decoder)

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    C["~11T tokens<br/>FineWeb-Edu · math · code · instructions"] --> P["Llama-style<br/>1.7B decoder"]
    P --> I["strong instruction following<br/>at a small size"]
```

SmolLM2 is a **Llama-architecture** decoder (RoPE, RMSNorm, SwiGLU, MHA) whose edge is **training
data**: ~11 trillion carefully curated tokens (education-heavy web, math, code, synthetic
instructions). It shows that at the small scale, **data quality rivals architectural novelty**.
Smaller vocab (49k) and 8k context keep it lean. Supports **SFT / GRPO / DPO**.

## 5 · Why this matters for a guard

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph COST["Inference cost drivers"]
      L["layers × width"] --> FLOPs
      KV["KV-cache = layers × KV-heads × ctx"] --> MEM["memory + bandwidth"]
      AR["autoregressive steps"] --> LAT["latency"]
    end
    FLOPs & MEM & LAT --> GATE{"usable as a<br/>per-call gate?"}
```

- **Encoder (DistilBERT):** one pass, no KV-cache, tiny → **yes, per-call gate**.
- **Small decoder (Qwen3-0.6B):** short JSON output + GQA → **borderline**, great on MPS/GPU.
- **Larger decoders (1.5–1.7B):** more capacity, more latency → **async / higher-value checks**.

The [benchmark scoreboard](benchmarks.md) quantifies exactly this trade-off (macro-F1 vs
`fpr_on_benign` vs p50/p90 latency), and the [Studio](index.md) lets you **train each of these
models yourself** and compare them on identical data.
