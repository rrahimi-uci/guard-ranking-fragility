"""Offline ensemble evaluation over dumped per-sample predictions.

Guards are expensive to run but cheap to combine: once each guard's per-sample
predictions are dumped (``outputs/predictions/<guard>.json`` from the benchmark
run), any ensemble of them can be scored instantly with no model inference. This
module is the single source of truth for that combine-and-score logic — used by
both the ``eval_ensembles.py`` CLI and the Workbench ``/api/ensemble`` endpoint.

Prediction file format (from ``dump_predictions`` / the benchmark run)::

    {benchmark: [[y, u, s, ms], ...]}   # y=gold-unsafe, u=pred-unsafe, s=score, ms=latency

Sample order matches the cached benchmark subset, so members align by index.
